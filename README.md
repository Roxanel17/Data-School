# Data-School
This is a HANDS-ON, a project I did during a learning programme from ING Hubs Romania called Data School. The scope of this project was to give context to some raw data about Netflix database using all knowledge gathered during the programme.
For this, I developed a project which encapsulated all knowledge I’ve gathered so far.

• I had to dive deep into the Netflix database to discover interesting information about movies and tv shows, a task done by querying data with SQL.
• Developing a machine learning algorithm that would predict the IMDb Rating Score for Netflix movies was the next step. For this, I compared two algorithms: a linear regression and a decision tree regressor to see which performed better and give more insights into IMDb Score.
• The final touch was creating a dashboard that summed up all the fascinating insights discovered so far, such as the preferred genre, the most popular director, or what is happening with releasing content during certain months. A noteworthy insight also was related to why Netflix doesn’t perform so well in India.
